<h1>Diversity</h1>
We all are different and unique in our own ways,what if everyone in the world was exactly alike? What if everyone talked the same, acted the same, listened to the same music and watched the same TV programs? The world would be extremely dull! I believe it's important to accept people for who they are. Differences are important and they should be respected because that's what makes everyone diverse.
