This project, created using HTML, explores the importance of diversity on the main page and provides an educational overview of major world religions. 
It highlights how differences in culture, personality, and beliefs enrich our lives. The project includes detailed information on Hinduism, accessible via a link on the main page.
This page covers its worship practices, key concepts, major gods, festivals, and symbols. Additionally, there is a practice page about the Taj Mahal, which I created using Code Avengers before starting this project in Visual Studio Code.
