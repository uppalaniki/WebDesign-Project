<h2>What Is The Taj Mahal?</h2>
<p>The Taj Mahal is one of the Wonders of the world it is an 
ivory white marble mausoleum which stands at 561 feet tall on
the south bank of the Yamuna river in the Indian city of Agra.

<p>It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan.Hehad 6 wives and decided to house the tomb of his favourite wife,Mumtaz Mahal. It also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan, the builder.

<p>Although the Taj Mahal was built for Mumtaz Mahal, Shah Jahan was also laid to rest in the tomb alongside
his late wife.This is one of my favourite wonders in the world beacuse it has so much Interesting history 
and everything about it is phenomenal.
